/* Expert power is based on what one knows, experience, and special skills or
talents.[8] Expertise can be demonstrated by reputation, credentials certifying
expertise, and actions. The effectiveness and impacts of the Expert power base may
be negative or positive.[4] According to Raven, there will be more use of Expert
power if the motive is a need for achievement.[2] The ability to administer to
another information, knowledge or expertise.[20] (Example: Doctors, lawyers).
As a consequence of the expert power or knowledge, a leader is able to convince
his subordinates to trust him. The expertise does not have to be genuine â€“ it is
the perception of expertise that provides the power base. When individuals perceive
or assume that a person possesses superior skills or abilities, they award power
to that person.[1]
