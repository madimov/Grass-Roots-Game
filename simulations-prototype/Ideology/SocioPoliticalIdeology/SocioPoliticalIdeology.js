http://4freedoms.com/group/admin/forum/topics/8-characteristics-of-a-political-ideology

An ideology is identified as political, as it acquires its own:
 - Representation by Political Party
 - System of Government: with a hierarchical delegation of control
 - System of Law: which at least covers criminal and civil acts and statements
 - Command & Control Centres:
 	normally large and permanent, from which the organisation is able to exert control
 	over the people and the surrounding territory. An entire network of these may be
 	used to control the whole country.
 - Recognisable Dress Code or Insignia:
 	by this means members of the group can recognise each other in any location,
 	and act together with greater force than disparate individuals 
 - Finance and Tax System: controls the economy and extracts revenue for the ideology
 - Indoctrination System: to inculcate children and make new converts.
